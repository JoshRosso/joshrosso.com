        <div class="about">
            <p>I am a Staff Architect at VMware creating value at the
            intersection of applications and infrastructure. Over the years,
            I've had the privilege of working in high-performing teams within
            start-ups to large enterprises. Within these teams, I've worn many hats
            including team lead, software engineer, architect, and developer
            advocate. I thrive in teams with an affinity for getting things
            done, pragmatism, and open source. Since 2016, I've been working
            in the cloud native ecosystem with a focus on building, running,
            and managing large-scale Kubernetes clusters in production.</p>

                    amounts of self-study to establish my development skills.
                    Overtime, I was able to contribute to products, projects,
